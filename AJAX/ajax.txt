All these are about making the app dynamic 

AJAX - Asynchronous Javascript and XML

HTTP requests - communication between client and server
API - Application Programming Interface


HTTP methods
get - request a resource from the server
post - add some data to the user 
put - Edit 
delete - delete resource fron server

XMLHttpRequest - browser object

JSON - Javascript Object Notation
In json object , key and value pairs, if strings must be enclosed with double quotes
for arrays, number and objects double quotes is not necessary 

Inorder to pass data between the server and the browser , we use text 

when we need to pass data from browser to server - use JSON Stringify
when data is passed from the server to browser - use JSON Parse

Fetch  - built in (fetch always returns a promise)
promise based
XHR is not wrong, but fetch is an alternative approach that has simpler and cleaner syntax
the end result is still the same. still we get dynamically, behind the scenes

fetch only treats only n/w errors as errors (like urls)
