Javascript is single threaded, synchronous language
Js executes the script one line after the another

Browser provides these functionalities - fetchData, getGeoLocation, setTimeout, setTimer
all these happen asynchronously 

asynchronous means things happening in the background 

async/await are built on top of promises

if a promise is successfully resolved, we can use the "then" to get the values

promise.then( (data) => {
    console.log(data);
});

then error is catched using the catch 

inorder to use await, async keyword must be used along with the function

await waits till the promise is settled 

async function someFunction() {
    await
}

const otherFunction = async() => {
    await
}
