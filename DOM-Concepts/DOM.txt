browser converts html code into Document Object Model

what we do 
select an element, decide the effect we want to apply to the selection

Session storgae - persists data only until the tab is open
when the tab is closed, the data will be removed 

setTimeout - runs function once after specific time
pass the function reference
duration in ms (1000ms = 1s)
default 0, will be explained with async/ await
returns unique integer
clearTimeout to cancel
on window object 

setInterval and setTimeout is found on the window object 

setInterval - runs function repeatedly at specific intervals
pass function reference
clearInterval - can be used to cancel

loadEvent - is fired when the whole page has loaded, including all dependent resources such as stylesheets and images.
this is in contrast to DOMContentLoaded, which is fires as soon as page DOM has been loaded, wihout waiting for resources 
to finish loading
